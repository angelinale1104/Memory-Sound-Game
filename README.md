* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.

* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons

* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

- I did not use any outside resources to help complete my submission. I have only used Google's RGB color picker to help me get the color of the background and the heading of the website.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

- One of the challenges I face was understanding the code in JavaScript. Though I have had some experience with Java and Python, the syntax for JavaScript is different so I was a bit confused at first. However, I was able to overcome it thanks to the detailed and clear instructions/ explanations that Code Path provided. Instead of just copying and pasting the provided snippet of code, I made sure to read all of the additional notes in the instruction to understand what the code is doing and what the correct syntax is.
- I also face some difficulty with the nested conditional statements toward the end of the script.js. Though I have learned about conditional statements and nested conditional statements, it still took me a bit of time to fully figure out what to do in each scenario. I overcame it by taking time to look at the provided flow chart. Additionally, I took a better look at all of the variables I have and understand what they are in order to use them in my nested conditional statements correctly.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- I have had a lot of fun creating this Sound and Memory Game using the help of Glitch. However, I can't help but noticing how Glitch has simplified a lot of the things for the users to create the websites. My question is: ***How do we develop websites by coding from scratch in the real industry without the help of tools like Glitch?***

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. 
- Though I am not sure how to get started on adding those features, I would definitely take the time to learn on how to do those 2 things if I have more time:
    * I would like to add a hint feature where the user can click on to get a hint in case they get stuck. The hint will be playing back what the sound sequence was 1 time so that the user can recall what sound they missed. 
    * I would also like to add a challenge mode where they can see how good their memory is by keeping track of how long the sound sequence can get before they lose the game. It would be a fun mode to play between friends/ family if they can challenge each other on which person can remember a longer sound sequence.
